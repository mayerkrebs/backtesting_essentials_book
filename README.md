# Backtesting Essentials

Companion code for the book *Backtesting Essentials: Research Principles & Python Implementation* by Martin Mayer-Krebs.

This book walks readers through the design and evaluation of trading strategies, combining core research principles with practical Python implementation. It covers the construction of a custom backtesting engine, statistical testing, optimization, and best practices for robust strategy development.

## Acknowledgments

This project owes much to the many reviewers who generously provided feedback on early drafts. Special thanks to Denis Trosman and Viktoria Sudraba for their particularly insightful contributions. I am also grateful to Cemre Pehlivanoglu, Sergey Hein, Kristina Williams, Henry Husband, Martin Kithinji, Aleksei Shkurin, Rishikesh Pelluri, Nakshatra Goswami, and Kevin Pergher for their thoughtful suggestions and sharp observations. They all helped make the book better. Any remaining errors are my own.
